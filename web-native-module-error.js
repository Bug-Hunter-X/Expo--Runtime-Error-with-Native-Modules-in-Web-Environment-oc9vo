This error typically occurs when using Expo's `react-native-web` integration within a React Native project and attempting to access native modules that aren't supported in the web environment.  The Expo CLI might not explicitly catch this during the build process, resulting in a runtime error in the browser.  A common scenario involves accessing camera, location, or other device-specific functionalities via native modules.
